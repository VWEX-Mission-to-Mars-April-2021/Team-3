learn how to upload a meme

## Retrospective Final Day

I was really good will the help we got we were never lost and always had some direction to go in

Communication was good in the smaller groups, larger groups made communication harder

We did well on our tasks we completed all except 11 and tecnically 8 but we did a figure of eight at the end

It would have been better to have more rovers as it would have allowed for us to test our programs better

There was usually always someone in our group so if we ever needed help we could ask for it

We could have done better to spread out the work at times
